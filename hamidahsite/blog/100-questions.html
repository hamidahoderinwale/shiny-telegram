<p><h2> 100 Questions </h2></p>
<p><i>April 2023</i></p>

<p><p>
For the SPARC 23 application, one of the prompts asked applicants to generate a list of 100 questions that piqued their interest. I thought it was a cool question, so here we go.</p>
<ol>
<li>Can a sense of responsibility be engrained in people without authority? Although, I have a better sense of obligation now, most of the things I feel like I have to do were once prescribed by teachers, parents, etc.</li>
<li>Would I ever be able to get to the same level of fluency and comfort with the English language if it wasn’t my first?</li>
<li>Why did it take me so long to come up with 100 questions? What does the amount of time this took say about me?</li>
<li>Would you consider humility to be a virtue, how do/would you act in accordance to your opinion on this?</li>
<li>Civilization has gone to its primitive state, post-catastrophe and you’re deemed the leader (can come up with a scenario where this makes sense, you have the most knowledge about a pre-catastrophic world, f.ex). In which ways do you attempt to govern?</li>
<li>You have 20 years to gain the most power on a global scale, what steps do you take? Some might say becoming the president of the US, I would be curious to see if anyone has more interesting ideas, like finding a way to commoditize water to the extent that by 2032, when droughts are more common, they have a significant amount of leverage, etc?</li>
<li>If wellbeing is relative, what’s the moral harm in bringing everyone down to a hunter-gatherers standard of living?</li>
<li>How could one design a really good ecology class? What if instead of teaching classroom norms (i.e. sharing) we had a rudimentary explanation of the Tragedy of the Commons, Free-riders, etc. How would this impact the adherence to the norms we wish to have in the first place.</li>
<li>What’s the % drop-off in culture generationally for those who immigrate to Western Countries? What would the quantified values be? (ethnic decisions able to made, language fluency, etc.)?</li>
<li>How susceptible I am to joining cults? If I was indoctrinated to joining the People’s Temple would I have been one of the earlier to leave before drinking the Kool-aid.</li>
<li>Why is my humour the way it is?</li>
<li>Why don’t we apply the gale-shapely algorithm to college admissions? A Questbridge/national residency match program seems good for all parties?</li>
<li>Is being able to give “unconditional love” just widening the distribution of things you’re willing to accept while caring about the people whom you choose to love.</li>
<li>If I found absolute passion for computer science in the modern age. Is an alternate industrial-age world one where I don’t have any passion of similar magnitude?</li>
<li>How much worse is my “organic” spelling due to auto-correct?</li>
<li>How would my life look different if I spelled “distraught” correctly in the 6th grade spelling bee? I could have come first instead of second, sigh.</li>
<li>Should philosophy “education” always be complimentary?</li>
<li>If philosophy is necessary and wants to exist as a stand-alone field, why don’t we have philosophy practitioners at every major organization/field of practice?</li>
<li>Why did I prefer writing in pen so much more when I was younger?</li>
<li>Why was there a time when I took my handwriting so seriously?</li>
<li>If I go to university in France, will I hate myself for not holding onto a group of friends that I already like?</li>

<li>Is stability and comfort is worthwhile?</li>
<li>What does it look like to implement psychedelic therapy at large in place of therapeutics and drug interventions?</li>
<li>What are the worst possible scenarios with having experienced ego death?</li>
<li>What would it take for the field of human computer interaction to go extinct? What if technologists became especially rudimentary, realizing user-optimization was utterly useless? How much worse off would we be?</li>
<li>What would a life without knowing your birthday look like? How would classes be divided? Would alcohol laws become more stringent (using experimental methods) or less stringent?</li>
<li>If a latte is coffee with milk. Would a single drop of coffee make a cup of milk, a latte?</li>
<li>Why are physicists among the best writers that I have encountered. From Feynman to James Jean, prose is prolific among the rotators of physical matter.</li>
<li>How are abrahamic prayers constructed. Is it a matter of mimetics that some have staying power? Survival of the ones with the most alteration lol</li>
<li>At what point does free-riding lead to market failure for Netflix subscriptions? (I&#39;m still salty smh)</li>
<li>Do we need to redefine our sense of purpose in the age of GPT? I always thought that I could lead a life of servitude to replace my guilt and dread. Do I just wallow on abundance in a post-scarcity world?</li>
<li>What’s the best minimal closet that I can make? What would the MVP for my closet look like that would be appropriate for 90% of situations.</li>

<li>How does one get better intuitions for their own optimal stopping points (I.e. maintaining a relationship, pursuing a research project). How many opportunities have I missed out on by not pursuing things further. How many other things could I have been doing if I stopped sooner?</li>
<li>Is the average philosopher (or average academic in the humanities) net-negative by virtue of the resources they have taken and looking at the tail-heavy distribution of academic impact?</li>
