<p><h2> a sense of aesthetics</h2>
    i guess this is what it looks like to embrace the quirk.</p>
    <p><i>August 8, 2023</i></p>
    
    <hr>
    <p>at some point i started saying that i&#39;m into aesthetics, interested in romantic philosophy. </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>here i go again with the big words. to be verbose...</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>anyways, i think it&#39;s true that i&#39;m into this kind of thing. it&#39;s not a lie at the very least. i read simplicius simplicissimus: the baroque-style german-book about the insufferable kid who became a theistic hermit apprentice, a  cute kid, studiously christian in the age of the thirty years war. insufferable, but less so by the end of the book.</p>
    <p>i relished in rousseau&#39;s confessions and his odd life that now i can only recall in vague remembrance (he&#39;s genevan right?)</p>
    <p>now i have the term &quot;sturm und drag&quot; etched in my memory. layovers in germany, i&#39;d think about how this is where these new considerations had their start. </p>
    <hr>
    <p>i never thought i was fashion-savvy. me? rejected it. in all honesty, i didn&#39;t even want it to apply. <em>cringe.</em></p>
    <p>i was the studious kid who had no time to care. right? i went through <em>that</em> phase where i hated pink, thought makeup was a travesty against authenticity.</p>
    <p>function over form. </p>
    <p>being called pretty was a worse compliment than being called smart, in the zero-sum world i fabricated for myself - praise for my erudition has been replaced by comments on my appearance. an abomination! things change. i&#39;ve changed. </p>
    <p>my views on the world also changed, priorities too. one could guess, not different than the rest. in this regard, i&#39;m grateful for it.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>sturm und drag and the german romantics.</p>
    <p><em>my movement.</em> the credo i quickly outfitted for the time-being.</p>
    <p>platonic beauty was this intrinsically valuable thing (incredible i know).</p>
    <p>i mean i probably always held this truth, but i&#39;m reaffirmed in my suspicion that having the vocabulary to articulate my inarticulable means a lot: actually important or not.</p>
    <p>liking pretty things was not cringe? </p>
    <p>crazy.</p>
    <p>wanting to replicate some of that was actually a real thing one could want: what does it mean that i place so much emphasis on the transmissibility of my beliefs?</p>
    <p>i can&#39;t let a feeling just be a feeling. it needs to be something i can express. something i can share, talk with others. have it be clear and understood. gloom that can&#39;t be put into words is just labelled as &#39;sad&#39;. i move on. verbal validation a requisite for emotion to manifest?</p>
    <p>weird.</p>
    <p>anyways...i couldn&#39;t articulate that i appreciated how things looked, some things more than others. it didn&#39;t feel like enough. </p>
    <p>i&#39;ve mentioned how i never enjoyed museums. sometimes it still feels like people are strolling by these coloured canvases, pretending to care. i&#39;m sure this is common experience, but it&#39;s not all the experiences that come with looking at the beautiful.</p>
    <p>on the things i like. i wear classic black converse. every year or so, i&#39;ll get my one pair of shoes. surf reddit, maybe browse through pinterest, ask a friend. i need a sneaker. can i run? can i walk? is it decently water-proof? socks soaked with water is still an annual experience, but some protection is nice. neutrals because they go with everything. before i didn&#39;t care or didn&#39;t spend time noticing.</p>
    <p>my new pair this year and i like how roughed up they&#39;d get. looked worn because they were. the original color dusted with a light wash of dirty dust. sometimes the lack of patience gets a hold of me and the laces get tied in an odd way, some additional quirk to be matched with my mismatched socks because i can&#39;t help but loose a sock in every pair. </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>may we all find our matching, mismatched sock. to be a dreamer.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>past-tense was unintentional, i&#39;ll keep them for a while. some things are being left behind though. some dirty dust has been washed away.</p>
    <p>i was brought up to dress &#39;sharp&#39;. i had glasses and wore classic department clothes, bought in bulk, bought on sale. i grew up and thrifted, scoured old closets, my closet is a river of black, white, shades of blue and green. things i liked. things i like.</p>
    <p>an (my) &#39;aesthetic&#39; is still hard to put into words, but seems less important now.</p>
    <p>plato argued that creativity, that art was &#39;ex-nihilo&#39;, that all creation of the artistic form was derived from divine inspiration.</p>
    <p>purity in ingenuity. simple. kinda basic.</p>
