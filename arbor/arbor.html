        <h1>Arbor</h1>
        <p>At Arbor, we believe in the power of opportunity and the potential of young technologists across Africa. Our mission is to support the brightest up-and-coming STEM talent, providing them with the resources they need to thrive and make a difference in the world. Arbor is "run" by <a href="https://hamidah.me/">me</a>. I put "run" in quotes, because the goal here is to simply transfer your funds to worthwhile projects and hopefully, publicly capture some of the learnings I come across along the way.</p>
        
        <h3>The Story</h3>
        <p>Growing up in Canada, I was fortunate to have access to opportunities that made me feel like most things were in reach. However, I internalized that many brilliant students around the world, particularly in Africa, can't say the same.</p>
        <p> This realization inspired to me to work on the projects that I have today, which also exposed me to the lack of attention it gets, and the opportunity that its neglect affords.</p>
        <p>I have worked with the Special Maths Academy—a Nigerian Math Olympiad training program—helping them secure the funding necessary to compete on the global stage. My journey also led me to support the Ghanaian team, learning about the incredible impact of MISE and their alumni who have gone on to prestigious institutions like Stanford and MIT. I currently work with <a href="https://naijacoder.org/">NaijaCoder</a>, continuing my commitment to fostering talent in STEM.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Arbor Exists</h3>
        <p>Through my work, I have witnessed firsthand the immense talent and drive of young African technologists. However, funding  always seems to be a barrier. These programs take a lot of agency and work to start, but struggle to keep their footing. Here are a few stories that highlight the need for this fund:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.sparc-camp.com/" target="_blank"></a>SPARC</a> and the Algerian International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) Team:</strong> An alumni from our network sought funding for the Algerian International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) team. Below is a screenshot of their email: </li>

            <li><strong><a href="https://misemath.github.io/" target="_blank">MISE Foundation</a>—Math Olympiad Program for Ghanian Students, MISE Research Program:</strong> Many successful MISE alumni, now at top universities, struggle to return home and contribute to their communities due to financial constraints.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://specialmaths.ng/" target="_blank">Special Maths Academy</a>—Nigerian Math Olympiad Training Program:</strong> Without funding, the Nigerian team was at risk of missing out on the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>We aim to create a fund that supports a diverse range of projects, from traditional Olympiads to innovative funding models. An example of the type of program we would be interested in supporting is <a href="https://malengo.org/">Malengo</a>. Malengo provides scholarships for Ugandans to study in Germany, financing the program with scholar income-share agreements, we would also be interested in microfinancing.</p>
        <p>I also plan on supporting projects however I can on an ad-hoc basis. Reach out if you think I can be of help (i.e. intros, talking through ideas, etc.). For starters, here is a small list of projects in the space:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://www.globtalent.org/">Global Talent Network</a>, and specifically their <a href="https://www.globtalent.org/nations">Nations</a> program.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.talentmobility.fund/">The Talent Mobility Fund</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.mercatus.org/announcements/mercatus-center-announces-launch-emergent-ventures-africa-caribbean">Emergent Ventures Africa & the Carribean</a></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Why Arbor is Different</h3>
        <p>Arbor stands out by explicitly seeking funds from individuals with connections to the region. We understand the unique perspectives and insights that come from personal ties to Africa. Your connections will help shape our priorities, ensuring that our initiatives are deeply rooted in the communities we aim to serve. We strive to be a high-impact initiative that you can contribute to, leveraging your knowledge and network to drive meaningful change.</p>
